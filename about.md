Please find my CV [in English](Huanfa_CV_20220214.pdf) or [in Chiese](Huanfa_CV_Chinese_20220214.pdf).

I am an Associte Professor in Spatial Data Science at the UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA). This is my research blog.

My primary area of research is focused on spatial optimisation, or using computational approaches to find solutions to spatial planning and decision problems, with applications in transportation, medical geography, land use, and public safety. More specifically, I have been working on the models, solution approaches, and open source software on this field. 

I am also interested in GeoAI, which concerns the use of artificial intelligence approaches for geospatial problems.

I integrate a wide range of computational approaches in research, which include deep neural networks, heuristic search (eg, tabu search, genetic algorithms), agent-based simulation, and reinforcement learning.
