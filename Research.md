## Research
### Designing Effective Police Patrolling Strategy on Street Network
* #### 2014 - Present
* #### Work with Prof. Tao Cheng
* #### Part of EPSRC-funded [CPC project](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cpc/)
* #### Design effective routing strategy for police patrolling in order to monitor the crime hotspots and respond to calls for service. Used methods include linear optimisation, heuristics, agent-based simulation.

### Spatio-temporal Modelling of Urban Air Quality in Beijing
* #### 2014.01 - 2014.09
* #### Work with: Prof. Qi Li
* #### Statistical analysis of the PM2.5 concentration time series data in Beijing. Building a spatio-temporal ARIMR model to predict the future air pollution level. The model has high predicttion accuracy.   

### A 3D Simulation System for Hazardous Chemical Leakage Accidents
* #### 2012.01 - 2014.09
* #### Work with: Prof. Qi Li
* #### Design and implement a 3D GIS system for simulating chemical leakage accident based on atmospheric dispersion models, to support emergency response.
