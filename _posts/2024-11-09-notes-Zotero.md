This post summarises key issues of using Zotero.

1. How to check current plan and storage usage?

2. Can add multiple email addresses to one Zotero account, see https://www.zotero.org/settings/email
3. Different ways to store and sync files of 'My library' (not in group library) on Zotero

|                | Pros                   | Cons                                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Zotero storage | Very easy to configure | subject to storage limit. 300 MB for free plans              |
| WebDAV         | Free                   | relying on external cloud service (ie Nut Cloud). Can't easily get the stored PDF. |
| Local storage  | Free                   | relying on cloud service (ie Nut Cloud, OneDrive, Dropbox) if the PDFs would be accessed in multiple laptops; requiring some efforts to set up; can't access the PDFs on Zotero webpage. |

4. The only way to sync and share files in a group library on Zotero is via Zotero storage. Group file storage always draws from the storage account of the group owner. 
5. If a group of people are sharing lots of PDF files in multiple group libraries, an economic solution is to let one person upgrades storage and then to create multiple group libraries. Another weird solution is to create a new account and then use this new account to create one or more group libraries, so that you have an additional 300MB storage on Zotero.
